# Modernized Course Management UI with React

## The Problem

Moodle's traditional course management interface suffered from several limitations:
- Built with legacy AMD/RequireJS modules from 2014
- Limited interactivity requiring full page reloads for most actions
- No modern UI patterns like drag-and-drop or inline editing
- Slow feedback loops when managing multiple courses or categories
- Difficult to maintain and extend with outdated JavaScript patterns
- Poor mobile experience with non-responsive layouts

Course administrators had to navigate through multiple pages and forms to perform simple tasks like reorganizing courses, toggling visibility, or moving content between categories. The developer experience was equally challenging with complex AMD module definitions and limited tooling support.

## The New Feature

The modernized Course Management UI brings a complete React-based replacement for Moodle's course/management.php interface. This new system provides:

- **Three-Panel Layout**: Intuitive navigation with category tree, course listing, and course details
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant feedback without page reloads
- **Modern Build System**: Vite-powered development with hot module replacement
- **API-Driven**: All operations use the new Course Management API with JWT authentication
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works alongside existing Moodle functionality
- **Component-Based**: Reusable React components for consistent UI patterns

### Key Benefits:

- **Faster Operations**: API calls instead of full page loads
- **Better UX**: Modern interactions like selection, filtering, and bulk operations
- **Developer Friendly**: Standard React development with modern tooling
- **Maintainable**: Clear component structure with separation of concerns
- **Future-Ready**: Foundation for adding advanced features like drag-and-drop

## Implementation Notes

The modernization approach creates a parallel React system that operates independently of Moodle's legacy AMD modules:

### 1. Modern Frontend Architecture

- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.x for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Framework**: React 18 with hooks and modern patterns
- **Styling**: CSS Modules for scoped, conflict-free styles
- **Bundle**: Self-contained IIFE that includes React and all components

### 2. Infrastructure Setup

```
moodle-3/
├── react-apps/                    # React development environment
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main.jsx              # Entry point and global API
│   │   └── components/
│   │       └── CourseManagement/ # Course management components
│   ├── package.json              # Modern Node.js dependencies
│   └── vite.config.js           # Build configuration
├── react-dist/                   # Production bundles
│   └── moodle-react.iife.js     # Single bundled file
├── lib/
│   └── react_helper.php         # PHP integration helper
└── course/
    └── management_react.php      # React-powered management page
```

### 3. Component Architecture

The course management interface consists of three main panels:

- **CategoryManagementPanel**: Hierarchical category tree with expand/collapse
- **CourseManagementPanel**: Course cards with details, pagination, and actions
- **CourseDetailPanel**: Course structure showing sections and activities

All components communicate through a parent `CourseManagementApp` that manages global state.

### 4. API Integration

Components interact with Moodle through the Course Management API:
- JWT authentication for secure API access
- RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Standardized error handling and loading states
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance

### 5. Security & Compatibility

- Components respect Moodle's capability checks
- CSRF protection via session keys
- Graceful fallback to legacy interface if needed
- No modifications to Moodle core files

## How to Test

### 1. Access the New Interface

1. Navigate to **Site administration → Courses → Manage courses and categories**
2. Or directly visit `/course/management_react.php`
3. You'll see the modern three-panel interface load

### 2. Test Category Navigation

1. **Expand/Collapse Categories**:
   - Click the arrow icons to expand category tree
   - Subcategories show with proper indentation
   - Course counts display next to each category

2. **Select a Category**:
   - Click any category name
   - Middle panel updates to show courses in that category
   - Selected category is highlighted

3. **Create New Category**:
   - Click "Create new category" button
   - Opens Moodle form with parent category pre-selected
   - After creation, return to see it in the tree

### 3. Test Course Management

1. **View Courses**:
   - Select a category to see its courses
   - Each course card shows:
     - Course name and summary
     - Teacher names
     - Student enrollment count
     - Visibility status icon

2. **Course Selection**:
   - Click a course card
   - Right panel shows course details
   - Selected course is highlighted

3. **Create New Course**:
   - Click "Create new course" in a category
   - Opens Moodle form with category pre-filled
   - New course appears after creation

4. **Pagination**:
   - If more than 20 courses, pagination appears
   - Navigate between pages seamlessly
   - Current page is highlighted

### 4. Test Course Details Panel

1. **View Course Structure**:
   - Select any course
   - Right panel shows:
     - Course title and details
     - All sections with names
     - Activities/resources in each section
     - Activity icons and names

2. **Quick Actions**:
   - "Edit course" link opens course settings
   - Activity count per section visible
   - Section visibility indicators

### 5. Test Development Mode

1. **Enable Debug Mode**:
   ```php
   // In config.php
   $CFG->debug = 32767;
   $CFG->debugdisplay = 1;
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   cd react-apps
   npm install  # First time only
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Hot Reload**:
   - Make a change to any component

   - Interface updates without page refresh
   - Great for rapid development

### 6. Test Production Build

1. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   cd react-apps
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Disable Debug Mode**:
   ```php
   // In config.php
   $CFG->debug = 0;
   ```

3. **Verify Production Mode**:
   - Reload the management page
   - Should load minified bundle from react-dist/
   - Check network tab - single bundle file loaded

### 7. Test API Integration
