## Test Execution Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Unit tests (external_test.php)
   - Verify core functionality
   - Check error handling

2. **Phase 2**: Integration tests
   - Complete workflows
   - Edge cases

3. **Phase 3**: API tests
   - HTTP layer validation
   - Authentication flow

4. **Phase 4**: Performance tests
   - Load testing
   - Optimization verification
